## Evolve Static – Project Structure

This project contains a static HTML/CSS/JS site originally mirrored from Webflow under a deeply nested path.

New standard structure (to be populated and wired up):

- `pages/` – top-level HTML pages (home, about, services, projects, blog, contact, utility pages, etc.).
- `assets/css/` – stylesheets.
- `assets/js/` – JavaScript files.
- `assets/img/` – images and other media.

The original mirrored files under `www3.waybackmachinedownloader.com/` are kept as-is for now and will be gradually migrated into this cleaner structure.
